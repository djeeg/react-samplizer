React Samplizer
==================================================

There are so many great community React libraries in the ecosystem, however I have found, I can not always get them to work in the same project together.

It is a lot easier for the library maintainers to see my bugs if they have a complete project to get started.

## Setup

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
